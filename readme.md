# Image-Based GPS Interface for Rover Navigation
In autonomous navigation, precise input of GPS coordinates is critical for the successful movement and control of robotic rovers. Traditionally, GPS coordinates are manually entered, which can be time-consuming and prone to user errors. To streamline this process, this repository introduces an image-based GPS input interface designed to simplify the navigation setup for rovers. By enabling users to select GPS points directly from an interactive map, the repository offers an intuitive and efficient way to provide navigation inputs.

This repository integrates image-based interaction with GPS data processing and is built as a [ROS (Robot Operating System)](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) package to ensure seamless integration with robotic platforms. Users can click on a map image, which is an [OpenStreet Map tile](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), the selected pixels are converted into real-time GPS data and fed to the rover through the ROS communication framework. This enables smooth interaction between the user and the roverâ€™s navigation system. The interface is particularly beneficial for field applications where quick route adjustments and intuitive inputs are essential.



	
	
## Structure of the package
* Download the repository.
* Create the [Ros Workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace) and inside workspcace, create a directory src.
* Inside `src` folder, download the repository and build the package.
* The package has one c++ client `get_gps_from_map_client.cpp` in the folder `src`, and has correspondind server is defined in `get_gps_from_map_server.py` located in `script` folder of this package.



## Workflow of the package
* First server need to be run by running the command
	`roscd get_gps_from_map`	
	`rosrun get_gps_from_map get_gps_from_map_server.py`

* In second terminal, client need to be run with followinhg command 
	`roscd get_gps_from_map`
	`rosrun get_gps_from_map get_gps_from_map_client`
		
* Once you up the client, you will see some messages on the client terminal. Client will ask you to either update the Reference GPS location or get the transformed GPS or exit the loop.
